The project aims to develop an app that helps users develop a better understanding of various financial topics, such as investments, budgeting, saving, and more, through an engaging and accessible experience.

The app is designed to make learning financial concepts fun and effective through a series of interactive games and preliminary lessons.

The user can choose between many courses by asking the AI which is the best, based on his knowledge and interests. The AI will provide the user with short written lessons summarized from recognized sources

The flow of the game revolves around questions generated and presented by the LLM, aiming to challenge players with different scenarios. Each player has 24 hours to respond, after which the Game Master evaluates all responses and generates the round's potential outcome, which is based on real-world financial data.

Additionally, the LLM provides score updates, reflecting the difference in "money" won or lost.
